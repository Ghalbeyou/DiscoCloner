DiscoCloner is a Python bot that can clone Discord servers. With DiscoCloner, you can easily copy categories, channels, and roles from one server to another.

## Installation

To use DiscoCloner, you will need to install the required dependencies. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone the DiscoCloner repository from GitHub:

3. Run the main.py file to start the bot:

## Usage

1. Input your Discord bot token when prompted by the bot. If you don't have a bot token, you can create one by following the Discord Developer Portal documentation.

2. Enter the command with a prefix that you want to use to initiate the server cloning process. For example, you can use !test or $start as the prefix.

3. Then enter the server ID you want the categories/channels/roles paste in them. The bot will then clone the categories, channels, and roles from the source server to the destination server.

4. The bot will print success messages for each successfully cloned category, channel, and role.
